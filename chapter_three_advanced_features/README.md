# Adding advanced features

Like table:

|  | Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 | Col 4 |
| -- | -- | :--: | -- | --: |
| Row 1 | Working | with | tables | is |
| Row 2 | quite | easy | and | seamless |
| Row 3 | using | the | built-in | editor |

And now to something completely different ;)

Hyperlink:
[Building hyperlinks also has a built-in easy to use editor](https://www.gitbook.io/dashboard/write) just click "Add link" button, paste a link into the textbox that appears in the dialog and click "Ok", after that add the link text in brackets that appear automatically in the edit text field and you're done!

Also possible to use block-quotes:
>Worthless people live only to eat and drink; people of worth eat and drink only to live.

>**Socrates**
